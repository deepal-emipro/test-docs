> #### TIP
> 
> We have introduced a combo snippet that is a Product Snippet Builder. It is advisable to check this snippet first on a test server instead of a production server because it can be a conflict with the old structure and can remove old slider data.
> 
> 
> Your old dynamic slider data will be deleted automatically when you will download the latest module from Odoo App Store.
