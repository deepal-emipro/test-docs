By default, Odoo allows guest users to complete the checkout process without creating an account but with this feature, you can restrict them to complete the checkout process without login.


* **Step 1:** Go to the Website -> Configuration -> Settings

* **Step 2:** Select Restrict guest user checkout as shown below  screenshot

Enabling this feature will redirect the guest user to the login page when they click on process checkout and after completing the log-in/registration process it will be redirected to the checkout page.
