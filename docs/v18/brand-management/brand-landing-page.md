### Brand Landing page



This feature allows you to display the landing page of a specific Brand. You can easily create some catchy web pages using our snippets and can easily assign it to the Brand. When customers click on Brand from Brand Slider at that time it will redirect to that specific brand landing page. Where you can show-case your brand-related CMS blocks, Offers, Product etc.


Step to configure Brand Landing Page:


* **Step 1:** Go to the website and click on the new button in the top right corner. Click on **New page** option and one pop will appear to enter the name of the page title and click on the continue button.
