### Attribute Swatches with Tooltip



* Swatches are the feature that allows for presenting product options by displaying the corresponding visual representation inside the Attribute Listing itself. They grab the customers’ attention and shape their decision-making behaviors.
* **Configuration of Swatches:** From the Backend, choose Attributes and open the appropriate attribute record to setup the Swatches. Upload the icon picture as seen in the screenshot below, then save the modifications.
