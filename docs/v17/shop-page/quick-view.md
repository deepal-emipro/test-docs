### Quick View



The Quick view symbol appears in the New product slider, all offer snippets, and other product sliders with dynamic snippets as soon as you enable that option.


Open Website Editor from the website and select the Clarico Vega option to activate Quick View. The Quick View option is available, as seen in the picture below. Save the modifications and enable that option.
