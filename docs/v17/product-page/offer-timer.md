### Offer Timer



An offer timer based on All Products, Product Category, Product, and Product Variants is available from us. On a product page, it displays the countdown to the remaining product offers.


You must set a pricelist before you can specify the offer timer. Verify that the website's settings have the discount and multiple sale pricing active. One pop-up window will open once you click on Add a line of pricing. Choose the relevant "Apply on" option, then set up the Offer Message, Start Date, End Date, and Display Timer..
