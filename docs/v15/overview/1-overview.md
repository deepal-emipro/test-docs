### Overview
Magento2 Odoo integration is necessary because the manual entry of data between the two platforms is impossible after a certain level of growth, where the data becomes more significant and more complex. Our Odoo Magento2 connector app automates your vital business processes. It eliminates the need for manual data entry in Odoo by enabling bi-directional data exchange between your Magento2 and Odoo. This module saves your time by automatically & instantly synchronizing your catalogs, orders, customers, and inventory data from your online store in Magento2 to Odoo. After installing this module, there will be a rare need to login into the Magento2 admin panel for managing business operations.
