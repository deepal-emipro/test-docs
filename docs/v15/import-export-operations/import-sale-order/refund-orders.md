### Refund orders



Pre-requirement steps to perform the credit memo and refund


1. **You need to choose the Online Refund process if the order was paid by (Bank Transfer, Paypal, Credit Card, Wire Transfer, etc.).**
2. **You need to choose the Offline Refund process if the order was paid by (Check, Money Order, COD, Purchase Order, etc.).**
3. **Credit notes can only be created at Magento if you have created invoices there first.**
4. **If you delete an item from the credit note and attempt to add another, Magento will have trouble creating a refund.**
5. **Magento allows you to create a credit memo only once. In the case of partial refund Magento allows to create multiple credit memos.**
6. **Order items are mandatory for exporting refunds on Magento.**
7. **Refund requests will be initiated through the Payment Gateway.**


Go to Magento > Sales > Invoices. Open any invoice and click on add credit note.


You can see there are three types of credit notes


1. **Partial Refund**: The credit note is created in draft and can be edited before being issued.
2. **Full Refund**: The credit note is auto-validated and reconciled with the invoice.
3. **Full refund and new draft invoice**: The credit note is auto-validated and reconciled with the invoice. The original invoice is duplicated as a new draft.


Select credit note option based on your requirements and then click on reverse button.

After successfully exporting the refund into Magento, “create At Magento” button will be invisible. Please check refunds into Magento by navigating to Magento Admin panel > Sales > Orders > click on that order > credit Memos or Magento Admin panel > Sales > Orders > credit Memos.
