### Schedule Activities



Introduce a new feature that will create schedule activity if any queue processes 3 times and has some errors or the whole queue is in a failed state or shipment or invoice is exported 3 times but has some errors.


We can set schedule activities by navigating to Magento > Configuration > Instances > Open Instance > click on Notifications smart Button.

2. **Activity Type :** Type of schedule activity i.e. To do, Email, etc.
