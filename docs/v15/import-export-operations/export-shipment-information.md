### Export Shipment Information

Once the Delivery order is created in Odoo for the Magento orders imported, you can export order shipment-related details to the Magento like carrier details, tracking reference, shipped order quantity. After performing the 'Export Shipment Information' operation, the connector will create a Shipment record for the Magento and export all the shipment details.
