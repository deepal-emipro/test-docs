As shown in the above screenshot, If you are managing the Packages. And those Packages having the “Addition Reference”, then while exporting the shipment information that package “Addition Reference” will export into Magento instead of the “Tracking Reference”.

If one Delivery has more than one package and all packages have “Addition Reference” then the package-wise line will be created into the Magento Shipment record.


As per the above screenshot, there are two different packages for the single picking record. And all having the “Addition Reference”.


The picking also “Tracking Reference” as shown in the below screenshot.

2. **Export shipment Using MSI**


the magento2 odoo connector allow to export shipment operation with MSI(multi source inventory) so if you need to export shipment from multiple sources then configure export shipment location in magento inventory location and set the location as per below image.

After that import the order and go to the delivery order and go to the magento info tab. Here, you will see location of the selected warehouse from magento website configuration will be set by default in magento inventory sources.

After that export shipment into Magento and check once shipment is exported successfully by navigating to the magento > sales > orders > shipments. Here, you can check inventory source is set which we defined into delivery order into Odoo.
