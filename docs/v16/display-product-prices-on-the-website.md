* Use of this feature to display the Price on the product page using the Price List. Either Included Or Excluded tax according to the business. If B2B (Manufacturer and Wholesaler) no need to display the tax on the price on the product page. Because they will get back that amount from the government. But for B2C we need to display the Including tax.
