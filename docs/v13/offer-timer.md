### Offer Timer



We are providing an offer timer based on All Products, Product Category, Product and Product variants. It shows the remaining time countdown of product offers on a product page.


To configure the offer timer, you need to configure a pricelist. Make sure the discount and multiple sale pricing are activated from the website settings. Once you click on Add a line of pricelist, One pop up will open. Select appropriate ‘Apply on’ option and configure Start Date, End Date, Display Timer and Offer Message.
