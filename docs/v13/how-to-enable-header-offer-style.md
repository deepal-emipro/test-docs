### How To Enable Header Offer Style?



* After selecting the header style, in some of the theme header offer text will be available by default. If you want to delete or edit them, then simply click on the **Edit** button from the top right of the webpage and edit that.
* If you have deleted offer texts and you want that section back, then drag and drop the snippet named ‘Header Offer Text’ from the Inner Snippets category and save your changes.
