### Get eBay Details



Upon successful configuration of eBay in your Odoo, we need to get the necessary data from eBay related to buyer and seller to carry out various import and export operations.


Go to **eBay / Operations** and a pop-up will open in which you need to select the eBay Seller, Sites, and GeteBayDetails. It will collect all the meta-data for the eBay website specified as follows:


* Site Details
* Shipping Details
* Site Policy
* Buyer Requirements
* Refund Details
* Payment Options
* eBay Durations
